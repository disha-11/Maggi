# Maggi
the tasty hot and fresh Maggie. though it's not healthy it is mouth watering which is just what we like to eat well at least me if not others....

recipe:

ingredients:
20 rupees
a kettle
1 cup water 
a pair of scissors 
a spoon
a plate to serve 

step 1: go out to a nearby shop and ask for a maggi packet which will exactly cost 12 rupees and now if you ask me what should i do with the rest of the money i would suggest you to give it to me but i am pretty sure you won't so anyway...ðŸ˜›

step 2:open the packet horizontally on the top with scissors  

step 3: empty the food onto the plate, now you will observe a bar of noodles and a silver packet.

step 4: fill the kettle with a glass of water, switch on the gas and set the kettle on the stove.

step 5 :once water starts boiling break the bar of noodles into 2 and put it into the the hot kettle with boiling water and same thing for the masala which is in the the silver packet.

step 6: once the food turns to be yellow in colour you can serve it onto the plate.

step 7: time to eat!!!!
